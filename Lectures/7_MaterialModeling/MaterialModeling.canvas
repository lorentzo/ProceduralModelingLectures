This is because material I/O is still not standardized and smooth between different DCCs and Game Engines.\n\nTherefore, in this lecture we will use Houdini to create geometry shape and create materials in Blender. Or, we will download model and create procedural material:\n* https://threedscans.com/\n* https://www.myminifactory.com/scantheworld/\n\nNote: material modeling in Houdini is performed using \"Stage\" network, which contains LOPs: materials (MaterialX), lights, cameras and renderers. Procedural textures in Houdini are created using COPs which are then used in material modeling using \"op:\" https://www.sidefx.com/docs/houdini/copernicus/working_with_cops.html#bringing-cops-into-lops-for-materials -- it seems that apprentice licence is not allowing this to work since image textures are limited."},
