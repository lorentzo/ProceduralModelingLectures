For example, if velocity is (3,1,0) and particle starting from (0,0,0) then in 1second it will be at position (3,1,0).\n\nSecond in Houdini is 24 frames. Frames in Houdini can be integer of float (sub frames).\n\nWe don't usually modify velocity of particles directly, we apply forces which are then solved into resulting force vector, which are then solved into acceleration and velocity. \n\nForce can be activated, deactivated or changed any time and keyframed.\n\nNote that force is also an attribute which each particles stores alongside position and velocity. We can track each attribute for each point for each frame using \"Spreadsheet\". \n\nAlso, we can visualize each attribute in Scene view (Guide).\n\nMultiple forces can be added to our particle system. Force is driving particle system and we can use various presets or create our own using VOPs and VEX."},
