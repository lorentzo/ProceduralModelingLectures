## Overview

Semester-length project.

Project is made of 3 milestones (A, B, C) that follow lectures and build one on top of another.
Dynamics (Lectures 2.1, 2.2, 2.3) will not be part of project.
Submission of all three project tasks is needed for passing the lecture.

Project is solved individually. No group/team projects.

Art style is not specified, choose based on your preference.

### Milestone A: Hard-surface buildings

Tasks: 
1. Find image references for inspiration for each building class design
2. Model at least 3 classes of parameterized building models. 
3. For each class create at least 3 instances with different parameters.

Lectures:
* Procedural hard surface modeling (Lecture 1.1)

Goals:
* Parameterized model must represent building model 
* Use at least 3 procedural modeling concepts introduced in lecture: boolean operator, beveling, scattering, structural placement (copy and transform along line, circle, etc.), etc.
* Write journal: design choices and main implementation concepts

### Milestone B: Terrain 

Task:
1. Find image references for inspiration for terrain design
2. Model parameterized base geometrical surface representing terrain
3. Group terrain by elevation
4. Apply different materials for each group
5. Place instances of 3 building classes on terrain (e.g., to form a small city)

Lectures:
* Procedural terrain modeling (Lecture 1.2)

Goals:
* Parameterized model must represent terrain
* Use at least 3 procedural modeling concepts introduced in lecture: noise, displacement, heightmaps, masking/grouping, etc.
* Write journal: design choices and main implementation concepts

### Milestone C: Foliage

Task:
1. Find image references for inspiration for foliage design
2. Model at least 3 parameterized foliage classes
3. For each class, create at least 3 instances with different parameters
4. Place instances of 3 foliage classes on terrain (e.g., to form forest)

Goals:
* Parameterized models must represent foliage
* Use at least 3 procedural modeling concepts introduced in lecture: scattering, instancing, attribute variation, etc.
* Write journal: design and main implementation concepts

Lectures:
* Procedural foliage modeling (Lecture 1.5)
