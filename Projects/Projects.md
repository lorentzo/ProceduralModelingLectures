## Overview

Semester-length project.

Project is made of 3 milestones (A, B, C) that follow lectures and build one on top of another.
Note: lectures on procedural modeling and dynamics (Lectures 2.1, 2.2, 2.3) will not be part of project.

Submission of all three project tasks is needed for passing the lecture.
Project is solved individually. No group/team projects.

Art style (abstract, low-poly, realistic, etc.) is not specified, choose based on your preference. Examples:

### Milestone A: Hard-surface buildings

**Submission deadline: TBA**

Tasks: 
1. Model at least 3 classes of parameterized building models. 
    * Before modeling, find image references for inspiration and brainstorm on design choices
2. For each class create at least 3 instances with different parameters.
3. Render at least 3 images showing instances for each class.

Minimum requirements for passing:
* Parameterized models must represent buildings
* Use at least 3 procedural modeling concepts introduced in lecture, e.g., boolean operation, beveling, scattering, structural placement (copy and transform along line, circle, etc.), etc.

Submission includes:
* DCC project file
* Renders
* Journal: image renferences, design and main implementation concepts, final results

Learning material:
* Procedural hard surface modeling (Lecture 1.1)

### Milestone B: Terrain 

**Submission deadline: TBA**

Tasks:
1. Model parameterized base geometrical surface representing terrain
    * Before modeling, find image references for inspiration and brainstorm on design choices
2. Create masks or group terrain by elevation to create layers, e.g., water, grass, forest, mountains, etc.
3. Apply different materials for each layer
4. Place instances of 3 building classes on terrain (e.g., to form a small city) on at least one layer
5. Try out different parameters and create at least 3 instances of terrain with buildings
6. Render at least 3 images showing terrain instances.

Minimum requirements for passing:
* Parameterized model must represent terrain
* Use at least 3 procedural modeling concepts introduced in lecture: noise, displacement, heightmaps, masking/grouping, etc.

Submission includes:
* DCC project file
* Renders
* Journal: image renferences, design and main implementation concepts, final results

Learning material:
* Procedural terrain modeling (Lecture 1.2)

### Milestone C: Foliage

**Submission deadline: TBA**

Tasks:
1. Model at least 3 parameterized foliage classes (e.g., bush, tree, grass, etc.)
    * Before modeling, find image references for inspiration and brainstorm on design choices
2. For each class, create at least 3 instances with different parameters
3. Place instances of 3 foliage classes on terrain (e.g., to form forest)

Minimum requirements for passing:
* Parameterized models must represent foliage
* Use at least 3 procedural modeling concepts introduced in lecture: scattering, instancing, attribute variation, etc.

Submission includes:
* DCC project file
* Renders
* Journal: image renferences, design and main implementation concepts, final results

Learning material:
* Procedural foliage modeling (Lecture 1.5)
